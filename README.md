# Mindfulness, Gender & Online Teaching: An Exploratory Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the dynamics of mindfulness teaching, focusing on gender and online teaching modalities. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset obtained through a nationwide online survey of 768 participants, the project report employs quantitative statistical analysis using R. Key steps include data tidying, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling using tree-based algorithms.
